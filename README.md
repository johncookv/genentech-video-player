# Genentech Video Player

A model phoropter will be created to house the Oculus Go. This is supposed to give the illusion that the user is looking into a phoropter. The Oculus Go will be in a fixed position, and the user will only be able to select videos to play using the Oculus controller.

## Requirements
1. Unity - see [this link](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-req/?locale=en_US#recommended-unity-versions) to see which version you should download. This project is using **2018.4 LTS**.
2. VR headset - this app was made for the Oculus Go
3. Text Editor or IDE - the two most used are Mono Develop and Visual Studio (not VS Code). Technically you can use any text editor, but these are the ones recommended for C#/Unity development.

## Nice to haves
1. Mouse - this makes navigating in Unity easier.

## Tutorials
1. [Unity Tutorial for Beginners 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K2SMZQRKnw)
2. [C# Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhQdlIFylQ8)
**Note**: I have not seen these videos. I learned from documentation and Udemy classes ([this one in particular](https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-vr-with-unity/)), but the videos linked above look like great free resources to get up and running.

## Unity Scene View Navigation
See [this link](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SceneViewNavigation.html) for great info on how to navigate (including how the mouse can increase productivity)
